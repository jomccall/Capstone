  Description:
    Purpose: This dataset was compiled originally to provide the National Water Quality Assessment (NAWQA) study units with an intermediate-scale river basin boundary for extracting other GIS data layers. The data can also be used for illustration purposes at intermediate or small scales (1:250K to 1:2M).

    The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Service Center Agencies should be acknowledged as the data source in products derived from these data.

    This data set is not designed for use as a primary regulatory tool in permitting or citing decisions, but may be used as a reference source.  This information may be interpreted by organizations, agencies, units of government, or others based on needs; however, they are responsible for the appropriate application.  Federal, State, or local regulatory bodies are not to reassign to the Service Center Agencies any authority for the decisions that they make.  The Service Center Agencies will not perform any evaluations of these data for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data.  Digital data files are periodically updated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The dataset was sourced from the USGS and modified by the USDA-NRCS National Cartography & Geospatial Center (NCGC) by updating the attribute table by appending the name fields for the 2, 4, 6, 8-digit HUs from the 1:2M USGS 8-digit dataset. NCGC also made attribute fields for 2, 4, 6, 8-digit hydrologic unit codes. Lastly, NCGC created fields for "Acres", "HU_8_state", "FIPS_C " (HUC2 state) and "Square Miles". The "Acres" and "Square Miles" fields were calculated from the area field while the dataset had a projection of Albers Equal Area. The dataset was then projected into Geographic, Decimal Degrees, NAD83.

These two fields were calculated from the area field while the dataset had a projection of Albers Equal Area.  The dataset was then projected into Geographic, DD, NAD83.
