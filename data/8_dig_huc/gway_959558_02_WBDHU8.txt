The Service Center Agencies will not perform any evaluations of these data for purposes related solely to State or local regulatory programs.

    Photographic or digital enlargement of these data to scales greater than at which they were originally mapped can cause misinterpretation of the data.  Digital data files are periodically updated, and users are responsible for obtaining the latest version of the data.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The dataset was modified by the USDA-NRCS National Cartography & Geospatial Center (NCGC) by creating 
a seamless dataset for the entire country for all 4 levels. NCGC has included attributes for hydrologic 
unit codes and hydrologic unit names. NCGC has also added a square miles field to sub-basin. An acres field 
already exists for each subbasin. The square miles and acres fields were calculated in Albers Equal Area, 
NAD83 by NCGC. At this time, not all records have attributes for all the fields, but may be filled in 
by the user for local projects or will be filled in at a later date. NCGC personnel have created 1 
shapefile from the national WBD HU8. This polygons shapefile has attributes for 2-, 4-, 6- and 8-digit 
with polygons for the 8-digit HUs.  For a complete description of the attributes and processes used to 
delineate hydrologic units to 1:24,000 scale accuracy, please refer to document Watershed Boundary 
Dataset (WBD) User Guide.

Entity_and_Attribute_Information:
  Overview_Description:
    Entity_and_Attribute_Overview:
      Hydrologic Unit delineation are closed polygons that encompass all area draining toward the lowest point (called outlet or pour point) 
in the polygon. Because of varying sizes for the different hydrologic unit levels: 
some polygons do not include all areas up to the drainage divide, but all areas 
are included up to one or more other upstream hydrologic units. A unique hydrologic unit code is
used to identify each hydrologic unit. The hydrologic unit codes start with the 2-digit Region number that
contains the 4-, 6-, and 8-digit hydrologic units. Each hydrologic unit has a unique hydrologic code.
    Entity_and_Attribute_Detail_Citation: Detailed information about the attributes is available from the Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) User Guide (wbd_user_guide.doc) that is available with each gateway request.
