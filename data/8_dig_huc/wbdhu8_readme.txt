This 8-digit HUC layer is considered "Unofficial" due to possible HUC name attribute changes in the future.

This dataset is being provided by NRCS as a courtesy to users who wish to use 2, 4, 6, and 8 digit 
attributes of the 1:24,000 data but do not want to wait until the 12 digit layer contains all attributes
for 2-12 digit HUCs.  This 8-digit HUC layer is considered “Unofficial” because one new 6-digit HUC
name and many new 8-digit HUC names exist but have not been certified by the USGS.  Many legacy 8-digit HUC 
names are also under review and consideration.
