# Species Diversity in Tennessee

This project was my Capstone project for the Nashville Software School Data Analytics Bootcamp. I explored biodiversity in the State of Tennessee by analyzing natural heritage species data.

## The Motivation:
As a Tennessee native, I've always heard that our state boasts a high level of biodiversity. I wanted to find data to analyze that could give me an idea of the scope of this, how it can be defined and discussed, and would give me an understanding of how the scientific community collects and presents this information.

## The Question:
How do watersheds in Tennessee compare in terms of species diversity? What is the scope of biodiversity in the State of Tennessee?

## The Data:
In my quest, I stumbled on Natural Heritage data; information about what species are found in different parts of the world. Nonprofit organization NatureServe hosts the bulk of this data, and has multiple member organizations and individuals who contribute to the larger dataset. This ensures that the methodology is consistent and scientists and other audiences can be assured of a certain quality standard. The gathering methodology has evolved with time but has basic continuity over the last 40 years. This particular state dataset is a compilation of observations from the past 40 years.

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation is one of the organizations that participates. I used data directly from their Rare Species Data Viewer, found here: https://www.tn.gov/environment/program-areas/na-natural-areas/na-natural-heritage-inventory-program.html

This is part of the Natural Heritage Inventory program which maintains a GIS database containing information on the distribution and ecology of rare plants, animals, and ecological communities across Tennessee. This data is managed by TDEC but any citizen can contribute species sightings to this dataset. I used full lists of species at both county and watershed levels.
